<strong>CMPE 434 Project 2 </strong>
<br></br>
This project is intended to provide an IRC client-server implementation with an android app as the client.
<br></br>
The server is created using a combination of nodejs, and the socket.io libraries. It is a simple multi-chat room that is hosted on the free redhat OpenShift server at http://nodejs-peterlyons.rhcloud.com.
